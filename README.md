🧬 Skill Genome

An AI-powered, bias-free talent evaluation and growth platform that goes beyond resumes.

Skill Genome is a futuristic AI-driven interview and skill analysis system that evaluates candidates holistically using resume analysis, GitHub/code assessment, real-time AI interviews, body language analysis, eye contact detection, and communication feedback. The goal is to map a candidate’s true skill DNA and provide a personalized growth roadmap.

🚀 Vision

Traditional hiring focuses too much on resumes and college names. Skill Genome changes the game by evaluating:
	•	📄 What you claim → Resume
	•	💻 What you built → GitHub & Projects
	•	🎤 How you perform → AI-powered live interview

This ensures fair, skill-first, bias-free hiring.
